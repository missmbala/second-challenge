Week 2 Front End Skills Bootcamp Challenge 

## Description

This exercise is a part of the second challenge for the Front End Skills Bootcamp. 

Starter code was provided. It required a completion of a series of tasks, including making a portfolio style website that includes a photo or an avatar of oneself, along with links to sections such as about me, my work and ways to contact. 

Further requirements include for the navigation links to work correctly and scroll to the corresponding sections, inclusion of the images of work pieces completed with the first one being larger than others, for the images to work correctly and take the user to that deployed application.

Finally, the page is meant to be responsive. 

This challenge helped me understand more about the relation between HMTL and CSS and allowed me to try to use it more independently and using more sophisticated styling and more complex tools.
